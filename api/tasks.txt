resources and functionality should be available through your API?

give examples of request URLs or code for your API

for each resource, describe which fields, such as id or title, are accepted


Aim for three kinds of documentation for your API:

	a reference that details each route and its behavior

	a guide that explains the reference in prose

	and at least one or two tutorials that explain every step in detail
